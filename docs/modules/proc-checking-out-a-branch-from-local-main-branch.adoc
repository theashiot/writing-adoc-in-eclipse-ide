= Checking out a branch from local main branch

[role="_abstract"]
Check out a branch from the `main` branch. 

When you check out a branch, the branch becomes your working branch. 

In this procedure, we assume that main or the default branch is called `main`.

.Prerequisites
* Your local `main` branch is up-to-date with the remote `main` branch.
* You are in the `main` branch.

.Procedure
. In the Git Repositories view, expand your working repository.
. Expand Branches â†’ Local.
. Right-click the `main` branch.
. Click *Create Branch*.
. Enter the name for the branch.
+
TIP: While naming the branches, follow the naming convention used in your project. See the contribution guidelines for your project for naming conventions.
 
. Click *Finish*.

Your working branch is now the new branch.
